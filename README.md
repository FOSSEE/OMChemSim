# OMChemSim: OpenModelica Chemical Simulator

The OMChemSim or OpenModelica Chemical Simulator is library of chemical system component models written in the Modelica language that can be used for chemical process simulations, such as creating binary phase envelopes, simulating a process plant flowsheet.

OMChemSim is currently developed and maintained by Prof. Kannan M Moudgalya's research group FOSSEE at Indian Institute of Technology Bombay.
