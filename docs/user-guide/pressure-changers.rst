Valve
------
A **Valve** is used to simulate the pressure manipulation process of a material stream.

The valve model has two material streams connection ports as:

 - feed stream
 - outlet stream

To simulate a valve, one of the following variables must be provided:

 - Outlet Pressure ``Pout``
 - Pressure Drop ``Pdel``

These variables are declared of type Real.
During simulation, value of one of these variables need to be defined in the equation section.

Simulating a Valve
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 1. Create a package named ``Valve``
 
 2. Create a model named ``MS`` inside ``Valve``. This is to extend ``MaterialStream`` model
 
 3. Extend the model ``MaterialStream`` and necessary property method from ``ThermodynamicPackages`` ::
 
	 extends Simulator.Streams.MaterialStreams;
	 extends Simulator.Files.ThermodynamicPackages.RaoultsLaw;
	 

 4. Create another new model named ``ValveSimulation``
  
 5. Similar to the ``MaterialStream`` example model, import ``ChemsepDatabase`` and create variables 
    for the compounds which are to be used from ``ChemsepDatabase`` ::
	 
	 import data = Simulator.Files.ChemsepDatabase;
	 parameter data.Ethanol eth;
	 parameter data.Methanol meth;
	 parameter data.Water wat;
	 
 6. Define variables for Number of components ``Nc`` and component array of size Nc ``C[Nc]``. 
    Also assign the variables created for the compounds to the component array ::
	 
     parameter Integer Nc = 3;
     parameter data.GeneralProperties C[Nc] = {meth, eth, wat};
    
 7. Now, create two instances of the ``MaterialStream`` model ``MS`` as one material stream instance will 
    act as input and the other one will act as output. To do this, open diagram view of ``ValveSimulation`` model, drag & drop ``MS`` twice. Name the instances as ``S1`` and ``S2``.
	
	.. image:: ../img/valve-ms-drop.png
 
 8. Now, Drag and drop the ``Valve`` model available under ``UnitOperations``. Name the instance as ``B1``
 
 	.. image:: ../img/valve-drop.png

 9. Now double click on ``S1``. Component Parameters window opens. Go to Stream Specifications tab.
    There are two parameters ``C and ``Nc`` for which the values are to be entered. 
    As the value for ``Nc`` and ``C`` are already declared earlier in step 6 while defining the variables, these variables are directly passed here instead of the values. Repeat this for remaining ``output`` instance as well.
	 
	.. image:: ../img/valve-in-par.png

 10. Now double click on ``B1``. Component Parameters window opens. Go to Valve Specifications tab. 
     Similar to material stream instance, there are two parameters available here ``C`` and ``Nc``. Therefore repeat the same step as material stream instances.
	 
	.. image:: ../img/valve-par.png

 11. Switch to text view, following lines of code will be autogenerated ::
 
	  MS S1(Nc = Nc, C = C) annotation( ...);
	  MS S2(Nc = Nc, C = C) annotation( ...);
	  Simulator.UnitOperations.Valve B1(Nc = Nc, C = C) annotation( ...);

 12. Now, connect the streams with unit operations. For this, switch back to Diagram view.
 
     .. image:: ../img/valve-connected.png
	 
 13. Switch to text view. Following lines of code will be autogenrated under ``equation`` section :: 
  
	  connect(B1.Out, S2.In) annotation( ...);
	  connect(S1.Out, B1.In) annotation( ...);

 14. Specify the pressure, temperature, component mole fractions and molar flow rate for the inlet material stream ::

	  S1.x_pc[1, :] = {0.33, 0.33, 0.34};
	  S1.P = 202650;
	  S1.T = 372;
	  S1.F_p[1] = 100;

 15.  Now specify the one of the calculation variables for the valve as mentioned earlier. Here, pressure drop ``Pdel`` is specified :: 

	  B1.Pdel = 101325;	

16. This completes the Valve package. Now click on ``Simulate`` button to simulate the ``ValveSimulation`` model. Switch to Plotting Perspective to view the results.
 
 .. note::
 		 You can also find this package named ``Valve`` in the ``Simulator`` library under ``Examples`` package.


Centrifugal Pump
-----------------

A **Centrifugal Pump** is generally used to provide energy to a liquid material stream. The energy supplied is in form of pressure.

The centrifugal pump model have following connection ports:

 - Two Material Streams:

	- feed stream
	- outlet stream
 
 - One Energy Stream:
	
	- power required


To simulate a centrifugal pump, Efficiency ``Eff`` of the pump should be provided as calculation parameter. 
The variable ``Eff`` is defined as of type parameter Real.
During simulation, its value can specified directly under Pump Specifications by double clicking on the pump model instance.

Additionally one of the following input variables must be defined:

 - Outlet Pressure ``Pout``
 - Pressure Increase ``Pdel``
 - Power Required ``Q``

These variables are declared of type Real. During simulation, value of one of these variables need to be defined in the equation section.
